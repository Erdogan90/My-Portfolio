# My-Portfolio
My portfolio as a web developer, showing various projects I worked on as well as my development throughout my time as a developer. 

## About me
My background started in acting. I studied and performed as an actor for 15+ years as I loved working on projects in a team for the entertainment of audience members. 
After struggling to get regular acting work I got multiple full time jobs ranging from working with technology to Customer service.
All of my previous employment taught me multiple skills and developed me as an individual, however none of them challenged me enough or made me feel like it was the career I wanted. 
I wanted a career that gave me the feeling of working on a project with a team for one or multiple people. I missed being challenged every day, solving problems, working towards an aim, feeling of learning something new every day and being creative again.
That's when I came across School of Code.
School of code gave me the opportunity to build a career in technology which I always loved and found fascinating. Learning to be a Full stack developer has been so exciting for me. 
I feel as though being a developer is giving me all I wanted from a career. It's giving me all the things I missed since my days acting.
I'm learning something new everyday and my passion for being a developer is growing everyday. 
My skills are getting better as I learn more and I dream of the day I get to type code as quickly, efficiently and cleanly as I write this README. 
So far on my journey on the School of Code bootcamp we have learned, Front-end, UX/UI and Back-end.
I can't say for now that I have a preference, however I must state that UX/UI has really caught my attention. 
Please take your time to look through my portfolio.
I will be adding more projects as the time goes along.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
