            <p>My background started in acting. I studied and performed as an actor for 15+ years as I loved working on projects in a team for the entertainment of audience members. 
            After struggling to get regular acting work I got multiple full time jobs ranging from working with technology to Customer service. 
            All of my previous employment taught me multiple skills and developed me as an individual, however none of them challenged me enough or made me feel like it was the career I wanted.
            </p>
            <p>     
            I wanted a career that gave me the feeling of working on a project with a team for one or multiple people. 
            I missed being challenged every day, solving problems, working towards an aim, feeling of learning something new every day and being creative again. 
            That's when I came across School of Code.
            </p>
            <p>
            School of code gave me the opportunity to build a career in technology which I always loved and found fascinating. 
            Learning to be a Full stack developer has been so exciting for me. I feel as though being a developer is giving me all I wanted from a career. 
            It's giving me all the things I missed since my days acting. I'm learning something new everyday and my passion for being a developer is growing everyday. 
            My skills are getting better as I learn more and I dream of the day I get to type code as quickly, efficiently and cleanly as I write this README.
            </p>
            <p>  
            So far on my journey on the School of Code bootcamp we have learned, Front-end, UX/UI and Back-end. 
            I can't say for now that I have a preference, however I must state that UX/UI has really caught my attention.
            </p>
            <p>  
            Please take your time to look through my portfolio. I will be adding more projects as the time goes along. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

        <p>Since the start of the School of Code I've been working on multiple projects.           
            Some of these projects have been personal ones and some have been part of my course working in a team. 
            </p>
            <p>Working on my own projects has given me the ability to practise what i learn every week on my bootcamp course. I'm practicing Html, Javascript, React, Postgresql. 
                Working on my own projects allows me to practise these skills at my own pace.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently working on an app in my spare time that looks to promote a healthy mind by presenting people with multiple options to keep their mood high or to help lift their spirits up when it’s low. 
            </p>
            <p>  
                All the projects I have worked on have been planned out with low and high fidelity frameworks to ensure either myself or my team have a clear structure in regards to our application aims.
